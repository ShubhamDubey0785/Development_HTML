# We can use the pass keyword to create an empty class too



# The split() method splits the string into substrings if it finds instances of the separator:
# a = "Hello, World!"
# print(a.split(",")) # returns ['Hello', ' World!']



# swapcase()	Swaps cases, lower case becomes upper case and vice versa
