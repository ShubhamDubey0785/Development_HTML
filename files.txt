File I/O in Python
Python can be used to perform operations on a file. (read & write data)

Types of file
1. Text files -=> .txt, .docs, .log etc
2. Binary files -=> .mp4, .mov, .png, .jpeg etc 

Open, read & close fileWe havw to open a file before reading or writing'
f=open("file_name","mode")
        file_name -> sample.txt, demo.txt
        r: read mode(by default)
        w: write mode, truncating the file
        x: create a new file and open it for writing
        a: open for writing, appending to the end of the file if it is exists
        b: binary mode
        t: text mode(by default)
        +: open a disk file for ipdating(reading and writing)



data=f.read()
f.close()



Writing to a filef=open("file_name","w)
f.write("This a new line") -=> Overwrites the entire file

f=open("file_name","a")
f.write("This is a new line") -=> Adds to the file


With Syntax
with open("file_name","a") as f:
        data=f.read()


Deleting a file
using the os module
Module( like a code library ) is a file written by another programmer that generally has a functions we can use.

import os
os.remove(file_name)
